This module aims to enhance the efficiency and management of available workers in Odoo's Field Service Management (FSM) module. It enables users to quickly identify workers who are available for new service orders based on criteria such as skills, categories, working schedules, and territories.

Key Features:

1. Filter available workers based on skills, categories, working schedules, and territories.
2. Analyze worker availability taking into consideration all service orders that overlap the specified time range.
3. Return a window action to display available workers in a list and form view, making it easy to assign them to new service orders.
